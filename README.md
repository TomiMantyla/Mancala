<h1>Mancala Game with SVM AI</h1>
<p>This is work in progress, so there is no AI yet.
Now there is just gameboard and simple opponent making random
moves.  Goal is to run massive amount of random games, let SVM or
some other method to find best moves. Maybe I should implent GUI too,
currently it runs only in CLI.</p>
